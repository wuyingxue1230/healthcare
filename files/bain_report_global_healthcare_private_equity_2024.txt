Healthcare Private Equity Market
2023: Year in Review and Outlook
Macroeconomic challenges have exacted a toll on healthcare buyouts,
but green shoots in deal activity reflect the industry’s strong fundamentals.
By Nirad Jain, Kara Murphy, Dmitry Podpolny, Franz-Robert Klingan, Vikram Kapur,
and Alex Boulton

At a Glance
Investors continue trying to unlock liquidity and raise capital for healthcare deals,
in a challenging fund-raising environment.
Biopharma deals represent the biggest share of healthcare buyouts, while new modalities
and innovative therapies such as GLP-1s transform the investment landscape.
As investors look to diversify their Asia-Pacific buyout activity, India is viewed as a place
to deploy healthcare capital at scale.
Private equity investors continue to pursue healthcare IT deals, with rising competition
from tech specialists and corporate investors.

The healthcare sector continued to be a hub of private equity (PE) deal activity in 2023, relative
to all PE deals across the world, despite higher global interest rates, inflationary pressures, and
broader geopolitical uncertainty (see Figure 1).

Across all regions, a number of common themes emerged. To start, biopharma deals along with
transactions involving related services, such as contract research organizations (CROs) and contract
development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), made up the largest share of global deal
value at 48% (see Figure 2). Meanwhile, in the healthcare information technology (HCIT) space,
deals for electronic medical and health record providers underscored the importance of nextgeneration IT in healthcare. We also tracked the continued rise of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists
(GLP-1s), which will have implications across the sector, including supporting continued growth
in the sterile fill finish market, where the leader, Baxter BioPharma Solutions (now Simtra), was
acquired by Warburg Pincus and Advent International.

Sources: Dealogic; AVCJ; Bain analysis

The year saw six deals in excess of $2 billion—the largest being the taking private of Syneos Health
by Elliott Investment Management, Patient Square Capital, and Veritas Capital—compared with
13 in 2022 and 14 in 2021, though with some large deals in flux. There have also been around 375 deals
below the $2 billion mark, a testament to high levels of activity at the middle and small levels.
Within North America, announced deal values came in around $29 billion, with biopharma
accounting for 25% of deal activity and 54% of deal value (see Figure 3). Activity in provider businesses
(historically a large share of US deals) slowed as those businesses experienced inflationary and labor
market pressures. Nonetheless, a number of provider deals closed across specialties such as oncology,
orthopedics, and cardiology with the opportunity to drive ancillary expansions relatively insulated
from broader healthcare and macroeconomic pressures. Case in point: TPG and Cencora’s (formerly
known as AmerisourceBergen) acquisition of OneOncology from General Atlantic for $2.1 billion.
In Europe, announced deal value fell approximately 44% year over year from $25 billion in 2022 to
$14 billion in 2023. Excluding EQT/Luxinva’s acquisition of Dechra Pharmaceuticals, the announced
deal value would have declined by about 70%. Constrained credit markets and continued disruption
from labor and cost inflation dampened activity in the retail health and provider sectors. Europe also
saw several announced processes that did not result in a transaction, as buyers and sellers failed to
align on valuations.

Diversification of investments in the Asia-Pacific region
In the Asia-Pacific region, deal activity was slightly lower than 2018–22 levels, with announced deal
value at around $14 billion (see Figure 4). China remains very relevant for investment, while India
represented the largest share of announced deal value. That said, investors seeking to manage
geopolitical risk began to broaden their horizons to other Asia-Pacific countries. India, in particular,
has seen a long-term rise in biopharma-related activity (for example, in generics and active
pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing), albeit with a slowdown year over year, while also
seeing growth in domestic demand driven by an expanding middle class and government insurance
programs (see Figure 5). These macroeconomic dynamics, coupled with a number of successful
exits from early investors in India—such as TPG’s sale of a controlling stake in Care Hospitals to
Blackstone—have propelled private equity sponsors to regard India as a place to deploy healthcare
capital at scale.

Responses to liquidity challenges: value creation and secondary
transactions
Sponsors faced a challenging fund-raising environment in 2023, at a time when overall exit volume
was decreasing and competition for fresh capital was increasing. In line with the overall PE markets,
sponsor exits in healthcare declined in 2023, setting up PE funds for a conflict in 2024 between
prolonging holding periods and the desire among limited partners for liquidity.
Fund sponsors have been strategizing about how to offset the impact on the internal rate of return
from longer holding periods via two mechanisms: first, by investing in incremental value-creation
opportunities, with an emphasis on commercial excellence, pricing, and margin expansion, and
second, by exploring alternative avenues for liquidity, both for the funds and their limited partners.
The latter approach has triggered a rise in the exploration of secondary transactions (partial/early
exits) including continuation vehicles.
In 2023, many buyout funds initiated secondary-dedicated funds; notably, Blackstone raised
$24.9 billion, $2.7 billion of which is earmarked to its inaugural GP-led continuation fund strategy.
In addition, Ardian, Lexington Partners, and Goldman Sachs collectively fund-raised more
than $50 billion for their secondary vehicles. Several factors make these instruments attractive:
secondaries provide GPs an early, often partial exit opportunity, allowing them to secure liquidity
to finance growth ambitions or return capital to investors, and boosting a fund’s distributions
to paid-in capital.
Continuation funds, another form of secondary transaction, buy time until the market
appropriately prices a holding’s potential. Moreover, bid-ask spreads for secondary market
continuation funds, where the seller is often a partial buyer, tend to be narrower than the
bid-ask spreads in primary markets.
PE firms have also sought to navigate the current environment by joining with other firms to tackle
larger targets, in addition to seeking partnerships with and capital from sovereign wealth funds
(as in the acquisition of Dechra Pharmaceuticals). PE firms are not immune to broader fund-raising
challenges: Preqin estimates that in 2023 there has been $3.3 trillion of global private capital
targeted by funds, but only $1 trillion raised. Large funds are capturing a greater share of allocations,
benefiting from strong fund strategies, commercial motions, differentiated pitches, and sectorspecialized investment teams.

Corporate M&A: Strategics’ access to lower-cost capital enabled sustained
biopharma deal activity
Healthcare corporate M&A value was up from 2022, bucking headwinds on biopharma from the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US. Pfizer announced its acquisition of Seagen for just under
$45 billion in the largest acquisition in biopharma since Abbvie’s acquisition of Allergan for
$63 billion in 2019. Strategics, especially large-cap biopharmas, have retained access to lower-cost
capital, which has fueled higher levels of activity compared with buyout funds. This level of activity
occurred despite intensified scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as seen in suits
over Amgen’s acquisition of Horizon, a deal announced in 2022 and closed recently.
In reaction to heightened FTC scrutiny, strategics appear to be prioritizing more modest
acquisitions that advance specific strategic goals and are less likely to arouse antitrust scrutiny—
for example, Merck’s acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences (see Figure 6). That said, corporate
healthcare M&A has seen 19 deals in excess of $2 billion in the first three quarters of 2023.

Macroeconomic headwinds buffet healthcare
Healthcare PE has outperformed other sectors across multiple market cycles and recessionary
periods; however, the reasons for this resilience have varied from cycle to cycle. Over the past
decade, deal returns were driven by revenue growth and multiple expansion—the latter a byproduct
of low interest rates and abundant credit. By contrast, the current inflationary climate has taken
a heavy toll on labor-intensive businesses, as labor shortages challenge many healthcare sectors.
Still, we see positive momentum generated from innovation triggered by the pandemic, which has
led to a range of new healthcare delivery models and modalities (such as remote physiologic and
therapeutic monitoring and at-home care), and new life-sciences capabilities (such as CDMOs’
supply expansion and Covid vaccine distribution). Segments propelled by this innovation have
continued to power deals, while segments with a more challenging cost structure look for ways
to improve margin profile. No two cycles are the same, but there are reasons for optimism about
the future of healthcare investing.

What to look for in 2024 and beyond
Following a slow start to 2023, growth signals have reemerged in the buyout market (see Figure 7).
In many geographies, inflation is cooling as the impact of higher interest rates take effect;
at the same time, elevated material and labor costs are showing up as higher reimbursements
for healthcare goods and services. In credit markets, rates are projected to remain elevated
through 2024. As investors adjust to these realities, we expect sponsor-to-sponsor and secondary
transactions to increase in 2024. Meanwhile, take-privates, carve-outs, and secondaries will
continue to represent an elevated share of deal activity as investors seek to unlock value.

Following a slow start to 2023, growth signals have reemerged
in the buyout market.

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

Given an improving macroeconomic backdrop, investors should consider these questions for
2024 and beyond:
•

When will generative AI transform the healthcare sector? Current pilots of generative AI
tools have focused on repetitive or expensive tasks such as documentation. When these tools
move to widespread rollouts that touch on the core competencies of organizations, the effects
will be significant and widely felt.

•

How will the HCIT landscape shake out? HCIT remains an important lever for healthcare and
life sciences organizations seeking to offset macro headwinds and make better use of data and
analytics. In this environment, both providers and biopharma companies are striking a balance
between adopting platforms vs. best-of-breed solutions. Within HCIT, Epic continued its
expansion in several offerings, such as its payer platform. The competition for assets is
intensifying, with traditionally nonhealthcare investors entering the space, underscoring
the need for strong playbooks in HCIT.

•

How will life sciences innovation continue to affect investing? During the past few years,
we saw strong growth in new modalities such as mRNA and therapeutic classes such as GLP-1s.
While the direct implications of growth are clear, there are significant downstream effects of
increased GLP-1 agonist uptake within pharma, healthcare, and beyond.

•

How will India’s role in Asia-Pacific play out? Investments in and strategies focused on AsiaPacific are evolving, and India’s favorable macro tailwinds have made it a leading destination
for capital. India has traditionally seen investments in biopharma and providers, and it is still
too soon to know whether green shoots in other areas such as health insurance technology firms
achieve comparable prominence, and whether these firms can parlay their success in India
to expand across Asia-Pacific.

•

How can financial sponsors effectively respond to liquidity pressures from their
investors? Sponsor-led secondary transactions, especially continuation funds, have increased
dramatically in the past decade. However, the record amount of capital raised for secondaries
is likely to increase competition in this space as well.

Given the mountain of capital waiting on the sidelines, competition for in-market deals is expected
to remain strong. Internal rates of return historically have been driven by revenue and multiple
expansion, which will be more challenging to achieve. PE sponsors will need to establish higher
confidence in value creation opportunities earlier, such that they can commit greater capital.
It is critical for sponsors to think beyond pure commercial diligence and evaluate a wider set
of operational, technological, and other factors such as environmental, social, and governance
considerations early in their process to create value quickly. Only a clear fund strategy paired
with strong investment screening, integrated diligence, focused teams, and post-acquisition
value creation plans will set the most successful investors apart in the year ahead.

Generative AI Will Transform
Healthcare
A once-in-a-generation technology surges into a centuries-old industry.
By Eric Berger, Nirad Jain, Kara Murphy, Dmitry Podpolny, Franz-Robert Klingan,
Vikram Kapur, and Alex Boulton

At a Glance
Generative AI promises to drive significant productivity gains, improve patient
and provider experience, and ultimately lead to better clinical outcomes.
The technology could lower administrative costs, speed biomedical research and
drug development, improve claims management, and help develop next-generation
diagnostic equipment.
Big technology companies are partnering with healthcare organizations to apply generative
AI, and investors are deploying capital in nascent companies built around the tool.
Investors need to consider generative AI’s disruptive potential on portfolio companies
and new investments, and identify opportunities to take advantage of the technology.

Foundation models, large language models (LLMs), and generative artificial intelligence (AI)
captured the attention of providers, biopharmas, payers, and investors over the past year, driven
by the promise of making healthcare delivery more efficient, innovative, and effective (see Figure 1).
While traditional, analytical AI has been used in healthcare for many years, generative AI is
distinguished by its ability to create new content, summarize and translate existing content,
and, ultimately, to “reason and plan.”

12

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

The technology has potential across many use cases, including these:
•

For providers and in care delivery, it promises to cut the time spent on documenting patient
visits and reimbursement-related communications, which would reduce clinician burnout and
lower administrative costs. Indeed, organizations such as HCA Healthcare are pursuing these
opportunities via partnerships with tech companies such as Google, in part because patients
may already be changing their behavior, using off-the-shelf tools to understand and inform
their interactions with clinicians.

•

In biomedical research and drug development, generative AI is speeding innovation, as
evidenced by the strategic alliance between Sanofi and BioMap, where Sanofi will use BioMap’s
AI platform to optimize the process of drug discovery. Molecular biology-specific LLMs are also
supporting predictive modeling of protein structure and target-binding affinity, in addition to
the creation of therapeutic candidates themselves.

•

Insurers and other payers have long made use of AI in data analytics, claims management
automation and adjudication, and quality and risk management. Now, they are implementing
generative AI for member navigation, an example being UnitedHealth Group’s virtual assistant
for patient communication.

•

Medtech companies, meanwhile, are focusing their investments on next-generation diagnostic
equipment to detect diseases via AI-enabled hardware, surgical robots with AI-powered
systems, or smart remote-monitoring devices. For example, Philips is partnering with Amazon
Web Services to develop generative AI to advance the company’s PACS image processing and
enhance radiology workflows, as part of its broader AI efforts in diagnosis and treatment,
connected care, and personal health.

•

As foundation models, computer vision, and other areas continue to mature, all types of
healthcare organizations will find opportunities to apply generative AI to support operations
across the value chain (such as supply chain management and back-office activities).

Ultimately, generative AI may reshape healthcare institutions’ core functional areas, presenting
an opportunity for investors to serve changing markets and adjust operations within existing
portfolio companies.

A nascent stage of investment
Healthcare investment in generative AI has just begun.
Technology companies are collaborating with major healthcare organizations to apply generative
AI tools. For instance, Microsoft and Epic have teamed up to reduce the time clinicians spend
documenting or replying to patient messages. Google is working with Bayer to automate drafting
of clinical trial communications in multiple languages and is partnering with iCad to integrate
AI tools in the company’s devices to detect breast cancer. IBM is working with Microsoft Azure
to analyze complex medical records. Ultimately, healthcare information technology vendors are
at the forefront of using generative AI, marrying the technology with their extensive networks
of providers and users.
Among investors, venture capital and growth equity funds have been deploying capital in
companies built around generative AI as a core competency. For example, Hippocratic AI,
a healthcare-focused LLM company, raised $50 million in a seed round co-led by General Catalyst
and Andreessen Horowitz. Genesis Therapeutics, a drug discovery platform that uses generative
AI to pinpoint novel drug candidates, closed a $200 million series B round, with participation
from Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, and BlackRock.

14

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

Mature private equity (PE)-backed companies are also investing in LLMs to drive operational
improvement in various areas including better clinician or patient engagement and lower cost
structures. For example, Syneos Health, taken private by Elliott, Patient Square, and Veritas, entered
into a multiyear deal with Microsoft to leverage OpenAI’s ChatGPT in clinical trials and commercial
programs. Similarly, Advent-backed Iodine Software has partnered with OpenAI to infuse LLMs into
its AwareCDI product suite to improve the software’s accuracy and efficiency.

The effects on portfolio companies and new investments
To get ahead of this rapidly evolving technology, PE investors must carefully consider the impact
of generative AI on their portfolio companies. Primarily, they need to assess the exposure of their
portfolio companies’ markets to generative AI disruption, paying attention to both the magnitude
and timing of any potential threats or opportunities. Bain has developed a framework to gauge
disruption risk, which assesses labor intensity, level of knowledge required to perform tasks, the
type and frequency of interactions with humans, and the value of augmented pattern recognition,
among other variables.
Businesses where the following are core elements of the value proposition face greater risk: creative
content generation, labor-intensive administrative processes and call center work, and text-writing
and summarization. For example, business process outsourcers that employ low-skilled labor
to generate communication for medical claims and denials may be places where generative AI
can automate or accelerate the processes. On the other hand, in healthcare businesses that rely
on expert guidance, such as physicians providing clinical recommendations, the technology poses
less of a risk for disruption, but instead may be viewed as an opportunity to democratize access
and improve quality.
In deploying generative AI at portfolio companies, investors should develop a focused strategy
with three key elements:
•

identifying opportunities to leverage commercially available generative AI tools;

•

consider building proprietary generative AI software where there is an opportunity to establish
competitive differentiation; and

•

defining generative AI governance and guardrails to ensure its proper use, such as update
policies and data security.

Similarly, investors should consider the implications of generative AI for new investments’ deal
theses, determining the disruption risk of generative AI and the potential for generative AI to unlock
value, as part of due diligence and value-creation planning.

The long-term potential of generative AI
Given the complexity and uniqueness of patient situations, much of the work in healthcare
requires human labor and judgment. Even areas where less discretion is needed, such as coding,
charting, and registry extracts, have seen limited impact from AI models due to relatively small
data sets available to train the algorithms. Generative AI promises to address some of these
challenges, and experiments will likely proliferate in the year ahead. These efforts and early
use cases have the potential to trigger strong labor efficiency gains—addressing the financial
pressures on organizations, improving the patient and provider experience, and leading to better
clinical outcomes.
We expect progress over the next year to come in select and focused use cases. Over a longer time
frame, the breadth and depth of generative AI’s impact on healthcare may well be transformative
across workflows, applications, and ways of working. Investors who are thoughtful about generative
AI’s impact on their existing portfolio companies and new investments will be able to harness this
technological change to generate returns and accelerate the transformation of the healthcare sector.

Over a longer time frame, the breadth and depth of generative
AI’s impact on healthcare may well be transformative across
workflows, applications, and ways of working.

Healthcare IT Hits a Speed Bump
Despite the slowdown in dealmaking in 2023, healthcare IT retains its appeal
to private equity investors.
By Caitlin Dowling, Nirad Jain, Kara Murphy, Dmitry Podpolny, Franz-Robert Klingan,
Vikram Kapur, and Alex Boulton

At a Glance
Despite a drop in deal volume in 2023, healthcare IT attracts investment due to its ability
to drive innovation and offset macro factors such as inflation, labor shortages, and
reimbursement headwinds.
Providers use IT to focus on revenue cycle management, clinical workflow optimization,
and patient engagement; biopharma on clinical trial digitalization, analytics, and real-world
evidence; and payers on member engagement and value-based care.
Increasingly, organizations must balance software integration, vendor management
optimization, tech stack simplification, and interoperability with best-of-breed solutions.
Artificial intelligence and the move toward platforms are transforming the healthcare
IT landscape.

Healthcare information technology (HCIT) sits at the intersection between the steady resilience
of the healthcare sector to recession and the high returns of the software and broader IT sector.
The result: an attractive upside potential with lower downside risk (see Figure 1).

In 2023, HCIT buyout activity slowed, with deal volume falling by a projected 23% from 2022,
driven mainly by a falloff in provider HCIT transactions (see Figure 2). Excitement around
digitalization, following the outbreak of Covid-19, resulted in a slew of portfolio companies
that are still early in their holding periods. Despite the decline in transactions, HCIT represents
10% of healthcare sector deal volume and has seen some sizable deals, including EngageSmart,
Nextech, NextGen, and CorEvitas.
Macroeconomic factors including inflation, labor shortages, and reimbursement headwinds
continue to push healthcare operators toward greater automation to raise labor productivity,
resulting in investments around workforce management, revenue cycle management (RCM)
solutions, drug development workflows, and payer-workflow support. This impetus comes
at a time of emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) models that could unlock process
efficiencies and outcome improvements for the industry.

Providers still seeking HCIT to improve their business
Recent Bain-KLAS analysis highlights that IT has become critical to providers as they navigate
challenges, accelerating investment in some pockets of the market. RCM, clinical workflow
optimization, and patient engagement are top priorities for new investments given that they
all deliver measurable return on investment (ROI) (see Figure 3).

Macroeconomic factors including inflation, labor shortages,
and reimbursement headwinds continue to push healthcare
operators toward greater automation to raise labor productivity.

Revenue cycle management. RCM creates value by enhancing collections and streamlining laborintensive processes, thus generating an ROI for providers. No wonder that providers cite RCM as
a top priority, anticipating higher spending for software across a broad set of subsegments including
revenue integrity, charge capture, and complex claims management. Select activity in 2023—
including TA Associates’ investment in Alpha II and Alpine’s acquisition of Medusind—
demonstrated private equity (PE) investors’ interest in this space.
Clinical workflow optimization. Providers are leaning on tools that improve workflow efficiency,
such as LeanTaaS’s expanded offerings with the AI tool iQueue Autopilot, or that enhance remote
patient monitoring—as in the case of the merger between LAMF, a special purpose acquisition
company, with Nuvo, a digital pregnancy care solution. Solutions that save clinicians time while
improving patient outcomes present valuable opportunities.
Patient engagement. Academic medical centers and health systems are focusing on enhancing
patient engagement as well as using data platforms to further address value-based care and data
monetization. Importantly, the benefits of improved patient engagement extend beyond providerpatient relationships into clinical trial applications, improving retention and compliance and
ultimately ensuring respect of trial timeline and better outcomes.

20

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

Biopharma and payers taking the next steps on HCIT
The role of HCIT in achieving efficiencies for providers is well known, but HCIT offers multiple
benefits to biopharma and payers, too.
Biopharma HCIT continues to focus on the role of clinical trial enablement and digitalization in
the wake of regulatory changes. Given rising R&D costs, biopharma companies look for solutions
that cut costs. As a result, some large e-clinical platforms could be interesting near-term targets.
In addition to e-clinical platforms, biopharma HCIT has opportunity to capitalize on real-world
evidence (RWE) and real-world data (RWD) trends. RWE and RWD have grown more popular in
recent years, as pharmaceutical companies become more sophisticated in analyzing data across
clinical and commercial use cases. Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of CorEvitas and the announcement
of CMS to require patient registry enrollment to access Alzheimer’s drugs under Medicare coverage
are examples of how critical real-world evidence and data will continue to be in the future.
Payers, meanwhile, have aimed their investments at technology that affects member engagement,
ranging from performance and quality to value-based care, including enablement such as care
coordination and patient engagement/navigation. The merger of HealthComp, a benefits and
analytics platform, with Virgin Pulse, a health and wellness company, exemplifies how payers
are integrating with patient platforms to drive care outcomes. Other pressing issues include risk
adjustment to payment integrity. Payers continue to look for ways to optimize these paymentrelated functions, which directly affect their bottom line.

Three themes to guide new investments
Investors should keep three themes in mind when evaluating HCIT opportunities.
•

Role of large tech companies and generative AI. Large, generalist technology companies
such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are expanding into HCIT, either through core services
such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platforms, or via AI
capabilities such as Microsoft partnering with health systems to use Azure OpenAI. Historically,
large tech companies lagged HCIT-focused firms due to lack of customization around healthcare
workflows, but some of their recent investments are targeting healthcare. Consequently,
more than half of the providers responding in a recent Bain-KLAS survey said they expect
to accelerate IT spending with large tech firms, a 12-percentage point increase from the prior
year. The exposure level presented by large tech players varies by HCIT subsegment.

21

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

HCIT businesses use generative AI as a tool to develop new products or improve existing
ones, although many of the applications remain in a nascent stage. That said, certain trends
have emerged. Among providers, for example, generative AI is helping to increase efficiency
and improve workflows, particularly when built into RCM solutions. And while just 6%
of health systems have a generative AI strategy today, about 50% are developing one or
are planning to. In biopharmaceuticals, generative AI is supporting and accelerating drugdevelopment workflows and enhancing commercialization capabilities (see “Generative
AI Will Transform Healthcare”).
•

Platforms’ role in integrating IT solutions. From provider to biopharma, organizations are
looking to maximize software integration, optimize vendor management, simplify their tech
stack, and enhance interoperability (see Figure 4). Tighter integration remains a key purchasing
criterion for companies evaluating IT solutions. Consequently, Epic is taking a greater share
of the hospital and health system space (more than 60% of US hospital market share by net
patient revenue), given its expanding network effects. Investors should carefully consider
Epic’s offerings and development roadmap, as Bain-KLAS research shows that most providers
prefer native electronic health record (EHR) offerings.
In the biopharma e-clinical space, many companies are trying to reorganize their tech stack
and provide a simpler access point for patients and clinicians. As a result, hub offerings such
as Veeva and Medidata that connect multiple stakeholders, digitize, and streamline steps
in the clinical trial and patient engagement/communication value chains will continue to play
a critical role. Biopharma companies are striking a fine balance between platforms and point
solutions, optimizing for the need of interconnectivity and decision-makers’ and users’ desire
to seek best-of-breed tools.

•

Investors’ integrated due diligence and post-acquisition playbook. As the market becomes
more competitive and risks evolve, integrated due diligence and post-acquisition playbooks
become critical for assessing and underwriting sources of value and winning deals. HCIT due
diligences have evolved from pure penetration and attach-rate analysis, toward integrating
commercial excellence, pricing, R&D optimization, product functionality assessment, techstack fit for purpose, engineering team’s ability to innovate, cybersecurity gaps, and other
operational and tech levers. Moreover, as HCIT platforms grow and offer less opportunity
for bolt-on acquisitions, the role of M&A becomes more nuanced as there will be fewer
transactions capable of meaningfully moving the needle.

The competitive landscape for PE firms
Healthcare PE investors face increased competition from specialized, tech-focused PE firms
such as Vista Equity Partners, Francisco Partners, and Thoma Bravo that are aggressively pursuing
healthcare with their software expertise, as well as increasing interest from strategics such as
Thermo Fisher. On the other hand, this increased competition also creates attractive exit pathways
for PE investors. Questions remain around which segments of the market may be played out, what
the next tech trend is, and how to manage risk: Is specialty HCIT insulated from Epic? What valuebased care technologies are scalable? What pharma IT solutions can become platforms?
Given the speed at which HCIT is evolving, and the presence of new competitors, the importance
of a clear fund strategy, integrated diligence, and ability to underwrite post-acquisition value
creation levers will be ever more important in the near future.

Life Sciences: Navigating Shifts
in the Innovation, Regulatory,
and Operational Terrains
Private equity funds must be nimble given the effects of new therapies
and sweeping Medicare drug negotiation provisions.
By Matt Sullivan, Nirad Jain, Kara Murphy, Dmitry Podpolny, Franz-Robert Klingan,
Vikram Kapur, and Alex Boulton

At a Glance
Although the life sciences sector continues to attract buyout activity, private equity
deal value in 2023 struggled to match the levels of 2022.
While the biotech funding slowdown is still a hurdle, investors began displaying more
comfort putting money to work in early-stage therapies and precommercial medical devices.
The ripple effects of the Inflation Reduction Act’s drug negotiation provisions, coupled
with greater investment in cell, gene, and RNA therapies, will have broad implications
for services providers.
Demand for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s)—such as Wegovy, Ozempic,
Mounjaro, and Zepbound—is boosting the need for ingredients or services that support
GLP-1 manufacture.

24

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

The life sciences sector has assumed a growing importance to private equity (PE) funds as investors
look for innovative, recession-resistant businesses. From 2018 through 2022, PE investments into
the biopharma, life-sciences tools, and diagnostics sectors surged, with approximately 650 buyout
deals consummated globally. Pharma services—including contract research organizations (CROs)
and contract development manufacturing organizations (CDMOs)—continued to be an active
vertical within life sciences, with deal value above 2022 levels. However, in the face of economic
uncertainty and continued high interest rates, overall life sciences deal value in 2023 struggled to
maintain last year’s pace (see Figure 1). That said, continued success will require expertise on the
part of funds, including operational and commercial excellence, in addition to scientific proficiency.

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

Four themes shaping life sciences investments
Four key forces are shaping the life sciences investment landscape and innovation:
•

the rise of the class of medications known as glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s);

•

the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) drug negotiation provisions and its ripple effects;

•

increased investment in advanced modalities such as cell, gene, and RNA therapies
and the implications for services providers; and

•

growing private equity interest in making investments in early-stage therapies
and precommercial medical devices.

Coupled with those forces, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to accelerate product
development and commercialization will continue to transform life sciences (see “Generative AI
Will Transform Healthcare” and “Healthcare IT Hits a Speed Bump”).

The promise and potential of GLP-1s
Over the past year, sales in the GLP-1 class of medications surged. Indeed, sales of Novo Nordisk’s
semaglutide—marketed under the brand names of obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes drug
Ozempic—and Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide—sold under the brand names of Mounjaro for diabetes and
Zepbound for obesity—have been limited only by the ability of manufacturers to produce them.
Initially used to treat Type 2 diabetes, the ability of semaglutide and tirzepatide to reduce weight
and evidence of their positive effect on cardiovascular and renal health have increased the appetite
for GLP-1s among prescribers and patients.
Given the potential market for these drugs, three implications confront PE investors:
•

Demand for inputs or services supporting the manufacturing of GLP-1 therapies will likely
increase. Firms that supply these goods—such as contract development and manufacturing
organizations (CDMOs) focused on peptides and biologics and manufacturers of delivery device
components such as autoinjectors—are poised to benefit from the growing demand and current
supply constraints.

•

An expanded ecosystem to support patients will be needed, including services to identify,
qualify, and enroll eligible patients, as well as physical or digital health platforms to support
patients on these therapies.

•

Finally, investments with business models based on high rates of obesity could see their longterm growth projections decline. Given the novelty of GLP-1s, their ultimate effect for now is
unclear. Still, investors should evaluate the implications for returns under a scenario in which
obesity rates decrease materially.

26

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

Ripple effects of the Inflation Reduction Act have begun
The direct drug price negotiation provisions of the IRA could affect global biopharmaceutical
companies profoundly given the outsize contribution of the US market to biopharma revenues and
profits. The first round of products subject to negotiation has now been announced, and by early
2024 pharmaceutical companies will have a clearer idea of the negotiated maximum fair prices that
go into effect in 2026 to participate in Medicare. PE investments in the biopharmaceutical sector
have tended to focus on derivative plays such as services and supporting IT, and the impacts of drug
negotiations look to be nuanced for investors.
For example, biopharmaceutical companies are expected to focus even more on biological
molecules such as antibodies, given the longer period between FDA approval and price negotiation
the IRA provides (13 years for biologics vs. 9 years for small molecules). Biopharmaceutical
companies will seek to be strategic, conducting multiple drug trials for the same molecule
in concert so as to maximize its use and application. For example, a molecule with the opportunity
to be used in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis may undergo trials on both simultaneously
so that in the event that the drug is approved for both conditions, the pharmaceutical company
can get the most out of its time window before Medicare negotiations.
Understandably, this is the domain of the biopharmaceutical giants that have the financial and
commercial wherewithal to coordinate multiple trials simultaneously and scale up manufacturing
quickly. In that case, more biologic assets may change hands during development, from smaller
biotech companies to biopharma giants. Indeed, there may be increased appetite among firms
of any size to partner with capital providers to support the development of promising molecules.
This effect, in turn, would be expected to flow through into supporting infrastructure, such
as contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) (see Figure 2).

The direct drug price negotiation provisions of the IRA could
affect global biopharmaceutical companies profoundly given
the outsize contribution of the US market to biopharma revenues
and profits.

Early innings of growth in advanced modalities
Next-generation modality therapeutics such as cell therapies, gene therapies, mRNA and other RNA
therapies, and antibody drug conjugates are riding a long-term growth trend. Growth has stemmed
from leaps in fundamental research as well as regulatory and commercial dynamics such as the
Inflation Reduction Act. Each modality has unique discovery, development, and manufacturing
processes that require discrete inputs and services to support the advancement of products.
Investment opportunities in this space are tricky to source and win given the requirement to find
technical niches and invest ahead of the derisking of the modality. But for those prepared to
compete here, the payoffs can be huge. This year, for example, ArchiMed and Warburg Pincus
exited Polyplus in a sale to Sartorius Stedim Biotech for $2.6 billion.

28

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

The disruption brought about by innovation in advanced modalities has led big pharmaceutical
companies and small independent biotechs alike to turn to outsourced service providers
to complement in-house investments—witness Bayer’s $250 million investment in a Parkinson’s
Disease cell therapy manufacturing facility. In turn, investors have sought to invest in contract
research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and CDMOs with
deep ties to pharma sponsors (see Figure 3). Two of the year’s three largest deals were contract
organizations—the taking private of Syneos Health and the carve-out of Baxter BioPharma
Solutions (now known as Simtra Biopharma Solutions). Investors had the strongest appetite
for contract organizations with specialized capabilities and expertise, such as Simtra’s strength
in sterile fill/finish, and smaller preclinical-focused CROs in Europe.

Next-generation modality therapeutics such as cell therapies,
gene therapies, mRNA and other RNA therapies, and antibody
drug conjugates are riding a long-term growth trend.

PE interest in early-stage therapies and precommercial devices has grown
Historically, activity involving early-stage therapies and precommercial medical devices has
been uncommon given the event-driven nature of these investments. But the evolving macro
environment and deal market is making some investors increasingly comfortable with evaluating
and underwriting such investments. For example, in November TPG led an $85 million series B
investment into MBrace Therapeutics, a preclinical antibody-drug conjugate player, via the TPG
Life Sciences Innovations Fund (TPG LSI) and The Rise Fund.
Competition with strategics for these assets raises the bar for technical and operations due diligence
on the part of private equity. Additionally, it’s essential to assess value creation opportunities during
due diligence to determine whether private equity ownership offers greater growth potential than
strategic ownership. To do this, private investors are building expertise in many ways including
upskilling technical investment teams, acquiring smaller life sciences-focused funds (such as
Carlyle’s acquisition of Abingworth in 2022), raising life sciences-focused investment vehicles,
and partnering more closely with professional services firms and operating experts.

Investors look past the sound and the fury
Looking ahead, life sciences innovation appears to be robust and well positioned to deliver
pioneering products that solve long-standing health needs and generate economic and societal
value. While the biotech sector ran into difficulties with fund-raising in 2023, investors appear
to be looking past the short-term noise and are prepared to invest in promising life science
innovations and in the services, products, and IT solutions to support those advances.
As a result, this domain has the potential to create attractive returns for their limited partners
while improving patient outcomes.

While the biotech sector ran into difficulties with fund-raising

Spending on private healthcare, growing pharma manufacturing and services, and an evolving
healthcare technology ecosystem are turning India into a private equity hub.

Healthcare markets in the Asia-Pacific region are maturing—and in parallel, private equity (PE)
deal volume is bucking the slowdown seen in North America (see Figure 1). Asia-Pacific’s share
of global healthcare PE deals continues to rise, growing from 26% of global deal activity in 2022
to a projected 34% in 2023.

The Asia-Pacific region has seen intensified deal activity outside of China—historically the main
engine of transactions in the area—and is being transformed into a region with multiple engines
of growth. Buyouts increasingly occurred across the geography, from the high-income economies
like Australia and South Korea to budding middle-income nations such as India. About two-thirds
of the deals in India were executed by funds with less than $50 billion in assets under management
(AUM), illustrating the wealth of activity outside of megacap funds.
In China, many investors have stayed on the sidelines as the country navigates an evolving
healthcare policy, Covid’s impact on public budgets, and a softening economy. Nonetheless,
Chinese activity has begun to rebound, rising from 21 deals in 2022 for a total of $1.6 billion in value,
to a projected 58 deals in 2023, reaching around $3.4 billion in value (see Figure 2). Overall, AsiaPacific buyout activity declined, from $17.1 billion in 2022 to $14.2 billion in 2023, though it held
up well compared with other regions.

Many biopharma and medtech companies have shifted toward a “China plus one” strategy:
diversifying beyond China and creating opportunity for input and final product manufacturers
in countries with deep talent pools, low labor costs, and business-friendly environments. Moreover,
private spending on healthcare is on the rise across Asia-Pacific, as economic growth lifts millions
of people into the middle class and health takes on new importance in the wake of the pandemic.
India stands out as the main force expanding Asia-Pacific’s share of global deal activity, accounting
for roughly 30% of the region’s deal value from 2022 to 2023 (see Figure 3). Resilient economic
growth, a business-friendly government, a maturing pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape,
and a burgeoning middle class eager to pay for quality healthcare have resulted in many investment
opportunities. In 2023, India is expected to host 22 healthcare deals, a slight decline from the 26
in 2022. Deal value is expected to come in at $4.6 billion in 2023, just below the $4.7 billion in 2022,
with India remaining the leader in deal value across the region.

Importantly, exits for investors in India have been strong, validating the country’s significant upside
potential. Deal selection was still critical to generate returns during this period, as demonstrated
by notable exits such as TPG’s 2023 sale of a controlling stake in Care Hospitals to Blackstone.
Global PE investors have grown more comfortable putting larger amounts of capital to work in
India, making the market more competitive. Moreover, more transactions are becoming controlling
deals, as the perceived risk of making large investments in India diminishes—including for owners,
who are often founders of the healthcare asset, and who are becoming more comfortable handing
over the reins to investors.

Three forces behind India’s rise
India’s rise as a new hub of healthcare PE deal activity stems from three factors: greater expenditure
on private and public healthcare, booming pharma manufacturing and services, and an evolving
healthcare technology ecosystem.

34

Global Healthcare Private Equity Report 2024

Spending on private and public healthcare: India’s fast-growing middle class is spending
more on healthcare. With disposable incomes rising and an explosion of insurance technology
(insurtech) platforms and private payers (such as Digit and Acko), private healthcare has become
more accessible. Moreover, Covid served to reset consumers’ attitudes about their own spending
on healthcare, as a large share of the population personally witnessed Covid-related tragedies,
shoring up the importance of health in their minds. Meanwhile, government health expenditures
have risen significantly over the past decade (from around 29% of total health expenditure in 2014–
15 to approximately 39% in 2021–22—S&P Global data), and healthcare spending is expected to grow
further (see Figure 4).
Demand for high-quality healthcare has been met with supply as more investors enter the market.
Multi-specialty hospitals have seen a flurry of activity over the past decade, including deals in 2023,
such as Temasek’s acquisition of an additional 41% of Manipal Health Enterprises (bringing its
ownership to 59%) for around $2 billion, and Blackstone’s acquiring a controlling stake in Care
Hospitals for some $800 million from TPG. More recently, single-speciality clinics have seen a surge
in activity, most notably with BPEA EQT’s acquisition of a controlling stake in Indira IVF, an in vitro
fertilization clinic chain, valued at $1.1 billion.

Booming pharma manufacturing and services: India’s stature in small molecule manufacturing
has risen. Supportive government policy (including the Production Linkage Incentive program),
a vast pool of chemistry and engineering talent, a strengthening pharma ecosystem, and a push
to diversify supply chains from China have propelled India’s rise to a top-3 global manufacturer
of pharmaceuticals by volume, and the top global generics manufacturer. Covid further boosted
India to the top position in vaccine manufacturing, supplying 50% of global vaccine demand.
For PE investors, India’s emergence as a leading pharma hub has created an opportunity in pharma
services, especially manufacturing services, such as contract development and manufacturing
organizations (CDMOs) and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) producers. Global PE funds—
including Advent International under its Cohance Lifesciences brand, Carlyle via drugmaker
Viyash, and PAG via Sekhmet Pharmaventures—continued to grow their API/CDMO platforms
started in 2021–22 with a number of add-ons.
While small molecules have been the focus to date, there are early signs that large molecules,
especially biologics, may be the next frontier as many such therapies start to go off patent, creating
opportunity for generics. But China may have the leg up in generics, given its deeper talent pools
in key areas of expertise such as microbiology.
Evolving healthcare technology ecosystem: India has historically served as the back end for
many US- and Europe-focused healthcare data and analytics companies, such as revenue cycle
outsourcers. However, in recent years, digital health companies serving the Indian market
directly—especially in fitness and wellness, such as HealthifyMe, telemedicine, such as Mfine,
and insurtech, including Turtlemint and Even—have seen brisk activity. While dealmaking
in digital health has slowed, long-term fundamentals, notably a young population eager
to engage digitally, remain strong for Indian companies operating at the intersection
of healthcare and technology.

Investors vie over opportunities
India’s share of global deal activity remains on an upward trajectory. Private providers
(both multispecialty and single specialty) present significant long-term opportunity, given
the fragmentation and underpenetration in healthcare currently. Investors that can scale up
to deliver high-quality care that meets the surging demand in the Indian market have the potential
to replicate the generous returns seen in recent years. Similarly, pharma manufacturing will
continue to present opportunity for private equity, given the sector’s fragmentation, supportive
government policies, and potential in biologics and generics.
The past few years have proved that the risk-return profile of investing in healthcare in India
is very favorable: For relatively small incremental risk above higher-income markets, the
potential for strong return is significant.
